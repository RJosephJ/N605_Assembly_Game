# N605_Assembly_Game
This project is a Pok√©mon inspired game built on the MIPS architecture for the NES

Rules:
There are two players with three playable characters that have three lives. The players can control these characters and throw projectiles at each other to get a hit. When a character is hit three times it faints and the next available character spawns. First player to faint all three opponents characters wins. 

Technical Aspects:
The game is completely built on assembly code (MIPS architecture) and is to be emulated on an NES emulator.
